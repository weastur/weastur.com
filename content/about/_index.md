I am an experienced, certified professional passionate about designing and managing robust, scalable systems. Over the past several years, I have gained extensive knowledge and experience in diverse areas of software engineering and infrastructure management, mastering various technologies and tools. My specialties include the following:

* Python programming
* Databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, Redis).
* Message queue systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis pub/sub, AWS SQS, AWS SNS).
* Cloud technologies (primarily AWS, as a certified architect).
* Container orchestration (Kubernetes).

As an intense advocate of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), I have developed complex environments using Terraform, CloudFormation, and Pulumi, bringing efficiency and reliability to the deployment process. Along with IaC, I am proficient in administering Linux systems and building Docker images, aiming for the utmost security and reliability.

My experience extends beyond infrastructural and administrative roles, as I have also contributed to several open-source projects throughout my career. I have honed my skills in several logging and monitoring tools, such as ELK, Loki, Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, and Grafana. Additionally, I am a certified Consul and HashiCorp Vault specialist, ensuring secure and efficient service discovery and secret management across systems.

Regarding leadership, I have thrice held team lead positions, managing teams as large as 25 people. From planning and reporting to conducting 1-to-1 meetings and hiring, I have shown myself capable of successfully leading and developing teams. Moreover, as a Python Course Instructor, I've shared my knowledge and fostered the growth of budding developers.

Currently, I am open to part-time work opportunities and can provide consultation on various technology topics. I am always enthusiastic to take on new challenges and assist teams in achieving their goals. Feel free to contact me with any inquiries, and I look forward to the potential collaborations that lie ahead.
